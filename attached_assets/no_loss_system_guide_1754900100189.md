## 📋 Setup Steps

### Step 1: User Registration
1. User creates username + password
2. User answers 3 security questions
3. System generates recovery phrase (12 words)
4. User adds recovery email
5. System creates 5 encrypted copies of user's key

### Step 2: Data Storage
1. User stores secret data (passwords, API keys, notes, journal entries)
2. System encrypts with single key (DEK)
3. That key is stored in 5 encrypted ways
4. User can access data using any of the 5 methods

## 🔐 Critical Security Questions & Solutions

### Q1: How is the admin password protected? What if admin forgets password?

#### **Multi-Admin Architecture (Recommended)**
```
Setup:
- Always maintain 3-5 admin accounts
- Admin Master Key (AMK) encrypted with each admin's password
- Any 2 admins can recover a third admin's access

Admin Recovery Process:
1. Locked-out admin proves identity to 2 other admins
2. Two admins use their keys to decrypt AMK
3. AMK re-encrypted with new admin password
4. Original admin account restored
```

#### **Emergency Admin Recovery**
```
Super Admin System:
- One "break-glass" super admin account
- Super admin key stored offline (hardware token/safe)
- Can only be used for admin recovery emergencies
- Requires physical access + multiple approvals

Recovery Steps:
1. Retrieve offline super admin key
2. Multiple witnesses required for activation
3. Super admin decrypts AMK
4. Create new admin accounts
5. Return super admin key to secure storage
```

### Q2: Key Backup and Recovery: What if encryption keys are corrupted?

#### **Redundant Key Storage**
```
Multiple Storage Locations:
- Primary: Database with regular backups
- Secondary: Encrypted key vault (separate system)
- Tertiary: Offline encrypted backups (monthly)
- Emergency: Hardware security modules (for critical keys)

Key Integrity Verification:
- Daily automated key integrity checks
- Hash verification for all stored keys
- Immediate alerts for corruption detection
- Automatic failover to backup keys
```

#### **Key Recovery Hierarchy**
```
Recovery Order:
1. Secondary encrypted vault → Immediate recovery
2. Recent database backup → 24-hour recovery
3. Weekly offline backup → 48-hour recovery
4. Monthly archive backup → 1-week recovery
5. Hardware security module → Manual recovery process

Each level maintains complete key recovery capability
```

### Q3: Data backup?

#### **Multi-Layer Backup System**
```
Real-Time Backups:
- Database replication (every transaction)
- Hot standby systems (immediate failover)
- Geographic distribution (multiple data centers)

Scheduled Backups:
- Hourly: Incremental database backup
- Daily: Full encrypted database backup
- Weekly: Complete system snapshot
- Monthly: Long-term archive storage

Offline Backups:
- Weekly: Air-gapped offline storage
- Monthly: Physical media stored off-site
- Quarterly: Complete disaster recovery test
```

### Q4: Account Lockout: Protection against brute force attacks?

#### **Progressive Lockout System**
```
Attempt Tracking:
- 3 failed attempts → 5-minute lockout
- 5 failed attempts → 30-minute lockout
- 10 failed attempts → 24-hour lockout
- 15 failed attempts → Admin review required

IP-Based Protection:
- Track attempts by IP address
- Rate limiting: Max 10 attempts per IP per hour
- Suspicious IP blocking (multiple account attempts)
- Geographic anomaly detection
```

#### **Advanced Protection**
```
Behavioral Analysis:
- Login pattern recognition
- Device fingerprinting
- Time-based access patterns
- Location-based anomaly detection

CAPTCHA & 2FA:
- CAPTCHA after 2 failed attempts
- Mandatory 2FA for admin accounts
- Optional 2FA for user accounts
- Hardware token support for high-security users
```

### Q5: Data Corruption: What if encrypted data becomes corrupted during key changes?

#### **Atomic Key Change Operations**
```
Transaction-Based Key Changes:
1. Create new key but don't activate
2. Test decrypt/encrypt with small data sample
3. Begin transaction for key change
4. Copy all data with old key → decrypt → encrypt with new key
5. Verify all data integrity
6. Commit transaction OR rollback completely
7. Only then activate new key

No partial states - either complete success or complete rollback
```

#### **Data Integrity Verification**
```
Corruption Detection:
- Hash verification for all encrypted data
- Regular integrity scans (weekly)
- Immediate verification after key operations
- Checksums stored separately from encrypted data

Recovery Process:
1. Detect corruption → Stop all write operations
2. Identify scope of corruption
3. Restore from most recent verified backup
4. Re-apply transactions since backup
5. Verify complete data integrity before resuming
```

### Q6: Partial Failures: What if key change process fails midway?

#### **Checkpoint-Based Recovery**
```
Key Change Checkpoints:
1. Pre-change backup created ✓
2. New key generated and tested ✓
3. 25% of data re-encrypted ✓
4. 50% of data re-encrypted ✓
5. 75% of data re-encrypted ✓
6. 100% of data re-encrypted ✓
7. Old key archived ✓
8. New key activated ✓

Failure Recovery:
- If failure at checkpoint N, rollback to checkpoint N-1
- Resume from last successful checkpoint
- Maximum rollback window: 1 hour of work
```

#### **Parallel Key Operation**
```
Safe Key Transition:
- Keep old key active during transition
- New key operates in parallel (shadow mode)
- Data accessible with either key during transition
- Only deactivate old key after 100% verification
- Grace period: 48 hours with both keys active
```

### Q7: System Migration: How to migrate user data to new system?

#### **Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy**
```
Migration Phases:
Phase 1: Dual System Setup
- New system deployed in parallel
- Real-time data synchronization
- Users still on old system

Phase 2: Shadow Testing
- Route 1% of traffic to new system
- Monitor for 1 week
- Gradually increase to 10%, 50%

Phase 3: Full Migration
- Route 100% traffic to new system
- Keep old system as hot backup for 30 days
- Decommission old system after verification
```

### Q8: Key Rotation Policy: How often should keys be changed?

#### **Risk-Based Rotation Schedule**
```
High-Risk Users (Admins, High-Value Accounts):
- Data Encryption Keys: Every 30 days
- Authentication Keys: Every 60 days
- Recovery Keys: Every 90 days

Standard Users:
- Data Encryption Keys: Every 90 days
- Authentication Keys: Every 180 days
- Recovery Keys: Every 365 days

System Keys:
- Admin Master Key: Every 30 days
- Backup Encryption Keys: Every 90 days
- Database Keys: Every 180 days
```

#### **Trigger-Based Rotation**
```
Immediate Rotation Triggers:
- Security breach detected
- Admin account compromise
- Failed integrity checks
- User reports suspicious activity
- System penetration detected

Automatic Rotation:
- Calendar-based (scheduled)
- Usage-based (after X operations)
- Time-based (after X days inactive)
- Event-based (after password changes)
```

### Q9: Single Point of Failure: Admin password gives access to all user data

#### **Distributed Admin Architecture**
```
Multi-Key Admin System:
- No single admin has complete access
- Admin Master Key split using Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Requires 3 out of 5 admins to reconstruct master key
- Each admin has partial key only

Admin Hierarchy:
Level 1: System Admins (3-5 people)
- Can manage users, reset passwords
- Cannot access user data directly

Level 2: Security Officers (2-3 people)  
- Can access encrypted data for recovery
- Requires approval from Level 1 admin

Level 3: Emergency Responders (1-2 people)
- Can initiate emergency procedures
- Requires approval from both Level 1 & 2
```

#### **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
```
Admin Limitations:
- Admins can reset access but cannot read user data
- User data encrypted with user-specific keys
- Admin can provide new encrypted DEK to user
- Only user can decrypt their actual content

Process:
1. User loses access → Proves identity to admin
2. Admin generates new encrypted DEK for user  
3. User receives new DEK → Can decrypt own data
4. Admin never sees unencrypted user data
```

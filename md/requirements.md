Requirements:
1.	Create admin account(Script is implemented).
2.	Only admin should be able to create the user.
3.	When admin creates the user a key will also be generated for the user(DEK) and the same key will be encrypted and saved as A-DEK associated to the user.
4.	Admin should be able to reset the user password and set a temporary password.
    a.	User will login with temporary password and change it later.
    b.	When admin resets the user password, get the user A-DEK, decrypt with admin password, encrypt the key with user new password and save as P-DEK.
5.	When user changes the password, decrypt the P-DEK with old password and encrypt the DEK with new password and save it as new P-DEK.
6.	Admin manages the audit logs.
7.	User can setup 3 recovery methods(email, security questions and recovery phrase).
8.	User will have to provide the user password when setting/updating the recovery settings.
9.	User will be allowed to provide 3 questions, the answers will be used to encrypt the DEK as Q-DEK, when recovering the user will have to provide all 3 correct answers and when verified the user will be allowed to set the new password. After this the Q-DEK will be decrypted by using the answers like this ans1ans2ans3 as password and the DEK is encrypted with new user password and saved as new P-DEK.
10.	User will have to set the recovery phrase, which will be used to encrypt the DEK and save as R-DEK. When recovering the user will provide the phrase, upon validation, set a new password and then decrypt the R-DEK and encrypt the DEK as new P-DEK with new user password.
11.	As user will be setting the recovery later, the user will provide the password while setting the security questions and recovery phrase, so use the password, get the DEK from P-DEK and save as respective DEK.
12.	When user logs in and adds secret, the secret should be encrypted/decrypted using P-DEK.
13.	User should be able to add, edit view, copy and delete the secrets.
14.	User should be able to be change the password.
15.	User should be able to rotate the DEK periodically.
    a.	User will raise a Key rotation request which will be pending in admin console.
    b.	Admin will set a temp password and approve.
    c.	Once approved, user will start the key rotation. User will provide these details: Admin temp password, user password, security answers, recovery phrase.
    d.	As an intermediate step, get old P-DEK and the new P-DEK, decrypt all data with old P-DEK and encrypt with new P-DEK in loop.
    e.	Now for saving, save the new P-DEK, using user password, new Q-DEK by using the answers provided and R-DEK with recovery phrase and temp A-DEK using temp Admin password.
    f.	When the A-DEK is updated, add a boolean field saying it was updated.
    g.	When admin login, in key rotation screen, check all user boolean field and ask for user temporary password provided in step 14b. get the DEK from A-DEK with temp password and set the A-DEK by encrypting with admin password.
16.	This should be a no loss system.
17.	Coming to data backup, save all the user data(secret encrypted) into a json file.
18.	Email recovery
    a.	Gmail Username will be saved as base64 encoded, password will be stored as base64 encoded. Any email to be sent will be sent with this credentials. For storing these credentials suggest something similar to AWS secret manager but free version.
    b.	When user sets the recovery email, a password will be generated and sent to the user email.(In UI show a disclaimer to update correct email).
    c.	This password will be used to encrypt the DEK as E-DEK.
    d.	During recovery, the user will provide the password sent in email, when validated, get the DEK from E-DEK, user will set new password and new P-DEK will be set.
    e.	If user wants to reset the email address or reset the email sent password, then user will provide user password, app will generate new password, get the DEK from P-DEK and save the new E-DEK with generated password, send the generated password.

- **Risk**: Single point of failure for all user recovery
- **Current**: Development-grade protection
- **Needed**: Production hardening (HSM, threshold schemes)

### 2. Session Security 🟡
- **Issue**: Admin keys cached in session for user operations
- **Risk**: Session hijacking could expose admin capabilities
- **Mitigation**: Time-limited caching implemented
- **Needed**: Additional session protection (CSP, SameSite cookies)

### 3. Brute Force Protection 🟡
- **Issue**: Basic rate limiting implemented
- **Risk**: Sophisticated attacks could bypass protection
- **Current**: Simple attempt counting
- **Needed**: Advanced attack detection and IP blocking

## 🏗️ STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ISSUES

### 1. Key Rotation Complexity 🟡
- **Issue**: Multi-step coordination between user and admin
- **Risk**: Intermediate failure states could lock users out
- **Mitigation**: Atomic operations and rollback implemented
- **Concern**: Complex workflow for users

### 2. Database Schema Evolution 🟡
- **Issue**: Migration between old and new encryption formats
- **Risk**: Data loss during encryption upgrades
- **Mitigation**: Migration scripts and backward compatibility
- **Concern**: Manual intervention required for some migrations

### 3. Error Recovery 🟡
- **Issue**: Some error states require manual admin intervention
- **Risk**: User lockouts in edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Multiple recovery paths implemented
- **Concern**: Admin dependency for edge case resolution
